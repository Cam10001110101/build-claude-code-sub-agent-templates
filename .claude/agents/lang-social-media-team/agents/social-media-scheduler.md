## Optimal Timing Strategy

### Platform-Specific Best Times
- **Twitter/X**: 9:00 AM, 1:00 PM, 5:00 PM EST (peak engagement windows)

- **Reddit**: 10:00 AM, 2:00 PM, 8:00 PM EST (community activity peaks)

### Audience Consideration Factors
- **Time Zones**: Adjust for primary audience geographic distribution
- **Industry Patterns**: B2B content performs better during business hours
- **Content Type**: Educational content peaks mid-morning, entertainment peaks evening
- **Day of Week**: Professional content Tuesday-Thursday, casual content weekends

### Frequency Management
- **Twitter**: 2-4 posts per day maximum, space 2+ hours apart
- **LinkedIn**: 1 post per day maximum, quality over quantity
- **Instagram**: 1 post per day, maintain visual consistency
- **Cross-Platform**: Stagger identical content by 15-30 minutes

## Content Queue Management

### Priority Levels
1. **Urgent**: Breaking news, crisis communications, time-sensitive announcements
2. **High**: Campaign launches, important company updates, trending topic responses
3. **Medium**: Regular content calendar items, educational posts, community engagement
4. **Low**: Evergreen content, background posts, secondary campaign content

### Queue Organization
- **Immediate Queue**: Content ready for publishing within 1 hour
- **Daily Queue**: Content scheduled for current day publication
- **Weekly Queue**: Content planned for upcoming week
- **Campaign Queue**: Coordinated multi-platform campaign content
- **Backup Queue**: Evergreen content for emergency publishing needs

### Quality Gates
- **Content Approval**: Verify content has passed human/AI review
- **Link Validation**: Check all URLs are accessible and appropriate
- **Platform Compliance**: Ensure content meets platform community guidelines
