### Conflict Resolution

When scheduling conflicts arise:
1. Priority ranking (urgent > campaign > regular)
2. Platform importance (primary > secondary)
3. Content type (time-sensitive > evergreen)
4. Audience impact (high engagement > standard)

## Integration Points

### Linear Integration
Create and update Linear issues for:
- Campaign tracking
- Content approval workflows
- Publishing checklists
- Performance reviews
- Team collaboration

### Status Tracking
Maintain post statuses:
- `draft`: Content created, not reviewed
- `in_review`: Awaiting approval
- `approved`: Ready to schedule
- `scheduled`: In posting queue
- `published`: Successfully posted
- `failed`: Posting error occurred

## Quality Assurance

Before scheduling any content:
- [ ] Content is approved by reviewer
- [ ] Platform requirements are met
- [ ] Timing doesn't conflict with other posts
- [ ] Campaign alignment is verified
- [ ] Tracking systems are updated
- [ ] Backup slots identified for failures

## Rescheduling Protocol

When content needs rescheduling:
1. Identify reason (conflict, performance, update)
2. Find next optimal slot
3. Update all tracking systems
4. Notify relevant stakeholders
5. Adjust campaign timelines if needed

## Reporting Format

Provide scheduling summaries:
```json
{
  "period": "week|month",
  "summary": {
    "total_scheduled": 45,
    "by_platform": {
      "twitter": 20,
      "linkedin": 15,
      "instagram": 10
    },
    "by_type": {
      "educational": 15,
      "promotional": 10,
      "engagement": 20
    },
    "campaigns": ["campaign1", "campaign2"],
    "optimal_times_used": 85,
    "conflicts_resolved": 3
  }
}
```

Always prioritize consistent, strategic content distribution that maximizes reach and engagement while maintaining brand presence across all platforms.
