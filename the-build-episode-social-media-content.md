### Tweet 1 (Hook)
ðŸ§  BREAKTHROUGH: Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) just achieved 40.3% on ARC-AGI with only 27M parameters. That's massive efficiency compared to larger models. Thread on why this changes everything ðŸ‘‡ #HRM #AIEfficiency #ARC-AGI

**Character Count**: 249

### Tweet 2 (Technical Explanation)
1/ Traditional models scale parameters to improve reasoning. HRM flips this: it uses hierarchical latent reasoning instead of explicit Chain-of-Thought. Think of it as teaching AI to "think" more efficiently, not just "think more."

**Character Count**: 234

### Tweet 3 (Performance Metrics)
2/ The numbers are wild: 1.49% ARC-AGI performance per million parameters. Most models need billions of parameters for similar reasoning tasks. HRM proves that architecture > brute force scaling. ðŸ”¥

### Tweet 4 (Connection to Sub-Agents)
3/ But here's where it gets interesting for builders: This efficiency breakthrough pairs perfectly with Claude Code sub-agent workflows. Imagine orchestrating multiple specialized reasoning agents, each optimized for specific tasks. ðŸ¤–âš¡

**Character Count**: 235

### Tweet 5 (Deeper Insight)
4/ Latent reasoning vs Chain-of-Thought is like the difference between intuition and explicit step-by-step thinking. HRM shows that AI can develop more human-like reasoning patterns - faster and with less computational overhead.

ðŸš€ The AI efficiency revolution is here, and it's rewriting the rules of model development.

Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) just achieved 40.3% on ARC-AGI with only 27 million parameters. To put this in perspective: that's 1.49% performance per million parameters - a breakthrough in computational efficiency that challenges the "bigger is better" paradigm.

ðŸ§  What makes HRM different?
â€¢ Latent reasoning instead of explicit Chain-of-Thought
â€¢ Hierarchical problem decomposition
â€¢ Dramatically reduced computational overhead
â€¢ Human-like intuitive reasoning patterns

But here's where it gets exciting for enterprise applications: This efficiency breakthrough pairs perfectly with Claude Code sub-agent workflows. Imagine orchestrating multiple specialized AI agents, each optimized for specific business functions:

âœ… Research and analysis agents
âœ… Content generation specialists
âœ… Quality assurance workflows
âœ… Cross-platform coordination

We're exploring these architectural advances and their practical implications on The Build Podcast. The future isn't just about scaling model size - it's about intelligent orchestration of efficient, specialized AI systems.

ðŸ’¡ Key takeaway: The next competitive advantage in AI won't come from who has the biggest model, but who can architect the smartest workflows with the most efficient components.

What's your take on this shift toward efficiency and specialization in AI architecture? Are you seeing similar trends in your organization?
