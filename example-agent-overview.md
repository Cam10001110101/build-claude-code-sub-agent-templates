### General Setup Notes from the Documentation:

- Subagents can be created either at the project level or personal/global level.
- Each agent has a separate system prompt, tool access, and context.
- Parent (general) Claude Code agent delegates tasks to subagents based on the type of task.
- Subagents can operate in parallel and report back their findings.
- Parent agent consolidates reports and can orchestrate the implementation of the changes.
